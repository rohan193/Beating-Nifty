    - Key support level at 75. Current price `29th Apr 2018` stands at ₹ 93.4
    - Stock not on an uptrend but on a sidewise pattern. Still current price makes a good case for point of entry
    - Wait for the stock to go lower(85-90). Check if news supports uptrend
    - `Update - 09th Jun 2018` - Goof call, although I entered early. Also the stock did bounce back from the critical support level

    - **Wait for the quarterly results of Jun 2018. Since there was money kept in reserves I belive the profit in this quarter will show growth and the stock may rise** - read for predictions and choose a point of entry - If money isnt available, study the effects of either case - rise/ fall
