## Mutual fund investment

### Identifying mutual funds to invest in

- Metrics to be considered :
    - Returns vs. Category average vs. Nifty(compare for last 5 years)
    - AUM
    - How old the stock is (>3years)
- List as of Apr 2018    
    - HDFC Small Cap Fund (G)
    - Axis Focused 25 Fund(G)
    - IDFC Tax Advantage (ELSS) Fund - Direct Plan (G)
    - Any of the 4 stocks already invested in
    - IDFC Focused Equity - Direct (G)
    - Axis Midcap Fund(G) - Crisil rank 5
    - Kotak Select Focus Fund - Direct Plan (G)

- List of metrics(from reference material 2.1)
    - Popular funds suffer as the fund managers are forecase to invest at least 65% of the available cash
    - Few funds have shown attractive growth in last 2 years due to their higher risk taking behaviour but the probabilty of their strategy to always work is low
    - **Track record for last 10 years** : 
        - Look into the track of funds for last 10 years, the fund need not be the top in the list but rather a part of top 25(above average within category) consistently. Eg. - Aditya Birla Sunlife : This fund has outperformed both the index and category average. Also it's ranked in top 25 consistently

        - Has the fund been under the same fund manager? What is the track record of the fund manager across all the funds that he is managing?
        - What was the AUM in the fund then and now? Has there been an increase in the AUM in recent years? Will that create a problem for the fund manager?
            - AUM limits - LC(5k crores); MC(2k crores)
        - Check the track record of Risk vs. Return
            - Less risk and more return preferred
            - LC are less risky than MC
