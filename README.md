### Identifying stocks to invest in

- Industries wih the low P/E
- Industries with strong financials - Fundamental analysis
- Industries in sectors that show highest growth prospects

#### Industries wih the low P/E

1. PNB - 
    - Key support level at 75. Current price `29th Apr 2018` stands at ₹ 93.4
    - Stock not on an uptrend but on a sidewise pattern. Still current price makes a good case for point of entry
    - Wait for the stock to go lower(85-90). Check if news supports uptrend
    - `Update - 09th Jun 2018` - Goof call, although I entered early. Also the stock did bounce back from the critical support level
    - The projected growth rate from PNB is ~11%. Advisable to pull money out, cut losses and invest in stocks with higher growth projections. Also wait for the time it takes to clear out the scam details
    - **Wait for the quarterly results of Jun 2018. Since there was money kept in reserves I belive the profit in this quarter will show growth and the stock may rise** - read for predictions and choose a point of entry - If money isnt available, study the effects of either case - rise/ fall 
    
2. HEG - `09th Jun 2018` - Stock at a low P/E also the growth show is more than 30% in net profits. Need to read through the financials in more detail. Whats the dept to equity and plan for growth and who are the other players in category. Money unavailable for investment
3. Graphite India - `09th Jun 2018` - Same as HEG
4. Sanwaria Consumer - `09th Jun 2018` - Bought 190 shares at a price of ₹13.15. Good financials. Need to define target. Clear resistance level at ₹22 and ₹29
5. Prakash - `09th Jun 2018` - Slightly late from point of entry perspective, but good potential for grwoth. Need to perform FA and category comparison
