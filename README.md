## Investment details

1. PNB - 
    - Key support level at 75. Current price `29th Apr 2018` stands at ₹ 93.4
    - Stock not on an uptrend but on a sidewise pattern. Still current price makes a good case for point of entry
    - Wait for the stock to go lower(85-90). Check if news supports uptrend
    - `Update - 09th Jun 2018` - Goof call, although I entered early. Also the stock did bounce back from the critical support level
    - The projected growth rate from PNB is ~11%. Advisable to pull money out, cut losses and invest in stocks with higher growth projections. Also wait for the time it takes to clear out the scam details
    - **Wait for the quarterly results of Jun 2018. Since there was money kept in reserves I belive the profit in this quarter will show growth and the stock may rise** - read for predictions and choose a point of entry - If money isnt available, study the effects of either case - rise/ fall 
    
2. HEG - 
    - `09th Jun 2018` - Stock at a low P/E also the growth shown is more than 30% in net profits. Need to read through the financials in more detail. Whats the dept to equity and plan for growth and who are the other players in category. Money unavailable for investment
    - `08th Jul 2018` - Stock has reported high growth rate consistently. Plans to leverage the increase in demand of graphite electrodes from China. China is planning to increase the share of Iron and Stell produced from Electrical Arc Furnance from current 9% to 20% by the year 2020. It has also reduced it's exports so other countries adopt the same production technique to meet demand. Entered at 3323.90
